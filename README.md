# BrainBusters

## Overview
We created this app as a way for the students of LEARN Academy to organize and share their notes, ideas, blockers, assessment questions, and random stuff in one easy to use application. You no longer need to dig through Slack to find what you need, you can find it easier on BrainBusters.

## Features
BrainBusters is organized into five categories. In each of these categories you can make posts and comments to help and interact with your classmates. Create an account to get access to the BrainBusters app.
+ Class Notes: All posts and questions on class notes goes here.
+ Blockers: Having a blocker with some code? All posts and questions on blockers goes here.
+ Assessments: Having trouble on an assessment question? Check out posts and questions on assessments here.
+ Code: General questions on code, post and get some feedback.
+ Random: All things that don't fit into the other categories go here.

Mess up on a post? You can edit your post or even delete it if you wanted to.
